# PlayGame
This Repository is one of two used for my _BSCH_PT_GD_ Exam/Assignment. This Repository contains the Git Upload of the 'Final Game'. The Reason Been I had a Mishap of one sort or another with what, up till now was my Repository. However, Fortunately there is no actual Damage or loss. Just Inconvenience. 

The Address of this Repository is: [https://github.com/csstudent26/PlayGame](https://github.com/csstudent26/PlayGame), while the Address of the Previous Repository (and still Holder of my 8 Class Exercises) is: [https://github.com/csstudent26/2024_BSCH_CompSci_Griffith_College_R_O_D_3053007/tree/main/Assets/Scenes](https://github.com/csstudent26/2024_BSCH_CompSci_Griffith_College_R_O_D_3053007/tree/main/Assets/Scenes). 

This just named Repository contains a rough draft of the Final Game, which should be Ignored.
